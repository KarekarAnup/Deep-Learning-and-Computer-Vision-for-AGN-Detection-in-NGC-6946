# Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-for-AGN-Detection-in-NGC-6946
This project aims to leverage deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) within NGC 6946, also known as the "Fireworks Galaxy." NGC 6946 is a prominent spiral galaxy with high supernova activity and dynamic stellar formation, making it an intriguing subject for AGN study.
